# Next.js 15 App Router Data Fetching Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when fetching data within a page component using the `useEffect` hook in Next.js 15's App Router.  The issue involves inconsistent data display, sometimes resulting in an indefinite 'Loading...' state or displaying outdated data.

## Problem Description
The `about.js` page attempts to fetch data from an API route (`/api/data`).  While the API route functions correctly, the client-side data update using `useEffect` is unreliable.

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file presents a solution by utilizing the `use` hook to directly access data from the API route. This leverages the App Router's built-in data fetching capabilities for better reliability and performance.
